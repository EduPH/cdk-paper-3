@article{Hall1995,
abstract = {The electrotopological state formalism is developed further in conjunction with atom classification. The classification scheme is based on the characteristics of hydride groups: (1) atomic number of an atom as element identifier, (2) a valence state designation consisting of valence and simple connectivity 6 values (for each atom together with its bonded hydrogen atoms, as in -CH3 or -NH-), and (3) an aromaticity indicator. This scheme may be viewed as a three-dimensional array. In a few cases, bonded neighbor analysis is also required. The scheme is developed and illustrated. For each atom type in a molecule, the electrotopological state indices are summed. These atom type E-state indices, based on a summation of E-state values, are useful for database characterization, molecular similarity analysis, and QSAR. A QSAlU QSPR example is given for boiling point for a set of 245 alkanes and alcohols for which the standard error is 8.0 "C},

A straightforward public-domain reference implementation has been developed by the {MathWorks} and {NIST} as a strawman for such a class.
