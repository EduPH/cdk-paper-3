ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:We recently developed a freely available mobile app (TB Mobile) for both iOS and Android platforms that displays Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) active molecule structures and their targets with links to associated data. The app was developed to make target information available to as large an audience as possible.RESULTS:We now report a major update of the iOS version of the app. This includes enhancements that use an implementation of ECFP_6 fingerprints that we have made open source. Using these fingerprints, the user can propose compounds with possible anti-TB activity, and view the compounds within a cluster landscape. Proposed compounds can also be compared to existing target data, using a naive Bayesian scoring system to rank probable targets. We have curated an additional 60 new compounds and their targets for Mtb and added these to the original set of 745 compounds. We have also curated 20 further compounds (many without targets in TB Mobile) to evaluate this version of the app with 805 compounds and associated targets.CONCLUSIONS:TB Mobile can now manage a small collection of compounds that can be imported from external sources, or exported by various means such as email or app-to-app inter-process communication. This means that TB Mobile can be used as a node within a growing ecosystem of mobile apps for cheminformatics. It can also cluster compounds and use internal algorithms to help identify potential targets based on molecular similarity. TB Mobile represents a valuable dataset, data-visualization aid and target prediction tool.},

@article{Klekota2008,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of 'privileged' substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial.

RESULTS: Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed 'underprivileged' substructures and 'conditional privilege'-rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.},

@article{Hall1995,
abstract = {The electrotopological state formalism is developed further in conjunction with atom classification. The classification scheme is based on the characteristics of hydride groups: (1) atomic number of an atom as element identifier, (2) a valence state designation consisting of valence and simple connectivity 6 values (for each atom together with its bonded hydrogen atoms, as in -CH3 or -NH-), and (3) an aromaticity indicator. This scheme may be viewed as a three-dimensional array. In a few cases, bonded neighbor analysis is also required. The scheme is developed and illustrated. For each atom type in a molecule, the electrotopological state indices are summed. These atom type E-state indices, based on a summation of E-state values, are useful for database characterization, molecular similarity analysis, and QSAR. A QSAlU QSPR example is given for boiling point for a set of 245 alkanes and alcohols for which the standard error is 8.0 "C},

@article{OBoyle2008,
    abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Open Source cheminformatics toolkits such as OpenBabel, the CDK and the RDKit share the same core functionality but support different sets of file formats and forcefields, and calculate different fingerprints and descriptors. Despite their complementary features, using these toolkits in the same program is difficult as they are implemented in different languages (C++ versus Java), have different underlying chemical models and have different application programming interfaces (APIs). RESULTS: We describe Cinfony, a Python module that presents a common interface to all three of these toolkits, allowing the user to easily combine methods and results from any of the toolkits. In general, the run time of the Cinfony modules is almost as fast as accessing the underlying toolkits directly from C++ or Java, but Cinfony makes it much easier to carry out common tasks in cheminformatics such as reading file formats and calculating descriptors. CONCLUSION: By providing a simplified interface and improving interoperability, Cinfony makes it easy to combine complementary features of OpenBabel, the CDK and the RDKit.},
