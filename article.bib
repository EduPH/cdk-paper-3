@article{Hall1995,
abstract = {The electrotopological state formalism is developed further in conjunction with atom classification. The classification scheme is based on the characteristics of hydride groups: (1) atomic number of an atom as element identifier, (2) a valence state designation consisting of valence and simple connectivity 6 values (for each atom together with its bonded hydrogen atoms, as in -CH3 or -NH-), and (3) an aromaticity indicator. This scheme may be viewed as a three-dimensional array. In a few cases, bonded neighbor analysis is also required. The scheme is developed and illustrated. For each atom type in a molecule, the electrotopological state indices are summed. These atom type E-state indices, based on a summation of E-state values, are useful for database characterization, molecular similarity analysis, and QSAR. A QSAlU QSPR example is given for boiling point for a set of 245 alkanes and alcohols for which the standard error is 8.0 "C},

It is meant to provide sufficient functionality for routine problems, packaged in a way that is natural and understandable to non-experts. It is intended to serve as the standard matrix class for Java, and will be proposed as such to the Java Grande Forum and then to Sun. A straightforward public-domain reference implementation has been developed by the {MathWorks} and {NIST} as a strawman for such a class. We are releasing this version in order to obtain public comment. There is no guarantee that future versions of {JAMA} will be compatible with this one.},

The results from the investigation show remarkably stable performance from the derived in silico models in terms of statistical measures such as correlation coefficients as well as root mean squared errors (RMSEs) for the randomly selected external test sets. Also, the Bioclipse Modeling platform is utilized for introducing interpretation to the derived models.},

	Abstract = {The potential of the diverse chemistries present in natural products (NP) for biotechnology and medicine remains untapped because NP databases are not searchable with raw data and the NP community has no way to share data other than in published papers. Although mass spectrometry (MS) techniques are well-suited to high-throughput characterization of NP, there is a pressing need for an infrastructure to enable sharing and curation of data. We present Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS; http://gnps.ucsd.edu), an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. In GNPS, crowdsourced curation of freely available community-wide reference MS libraries will underpin improved annotations. Data-driven social-networking should facilitate identification of spectra and foster collaborations. We also introduce the concept of 'living data' through continuous reanalysis of deposited data.},

abstract="The concept of molecular similarity is one of the central ideas in cheminformatics, despite the fact that it is ill-defined and rather difficult to assess objectively. Here we propose a practical definition of molecular similarity in the context of drug discovery: molecules A and B are similar if a medicinal chemist would be likely to synthesise and test them around the same time as part of the same medicinal chemistry program. The attraction of such a definition is that it matches one of the key uses of similarity measures in early-stage drug discovery. If we make the assumption that molecules in the same compound activity table in a medicinal chemistry paper were considered similar by the authors of the paper, we can create a dataset of similar molecules from the medicinal chemistry literature. Furthermore, molecules with decreasing levels of similarity to a reference can be found by either ordering molecules in an activity table by their activity, or by considering activity tables in different papers which have at least one molecule in common.",
